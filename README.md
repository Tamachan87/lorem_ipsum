# lorem_ipsum: The gem!
A simple gem that generates paragraphs of lorem dummy text using a single line of Ruby code, allowing you to get on with your design.

## Usage
To use the lorem_ipsum gem, just require it and add the following line to your .erb file.

    <%= Lorem.para(1) %>

And, hey presto! A single paragraph of lorem text appears! Add as many or as little paragraphs as you need.

NOTE: Currently only works in IRB. Working on making it a Rails gem.
